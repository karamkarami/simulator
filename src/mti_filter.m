function y = mti_filter(x, coeffs, staggerIdx)
%MTI_FILTER  Clutter cancellation along slow time.
%   y = MTI_FILTER(x, coeffs, staggerIdx) filters x [nBeams x nRange x nPulses]
%   (oldest pulse first) along the pulse dimension. coeffs [nStagger x L] holds
%   one set of L weights per stagger position; output m uses pulses m ... m+L-1
%   and the weights of the stagger position of pulse m. With a fixed PRF there
%   is a single row [1 -2 1] (three-pulse canceller).
